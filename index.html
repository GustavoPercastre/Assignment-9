        <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1>
        <p>What had worked well for me for the past 9 weeks was the constant help Mr. Boyer gave me. I was able to succeed and work during this course.</p>

        <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>I would probably only change the speed at which this course went by. Because I feel like we really didn't stay on one topic for long. But I do understand that this is an accelerated course.</p>

        <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1> 
        <p>Yes I did and even a little more. Because we learned how to code a website but we also learned some tools of the trade in this industry, and how to correctly style our webpage.</p>

        <h1>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>Mostly everything in this course was new to me. Because I did take a small course back in high school but that class mostly relied on self teachings.</p>
